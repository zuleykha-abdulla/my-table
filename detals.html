            <p>Ten months ago Simon found some old letters. They were from my old boyfriend, Geoff. My husband, Peter wasn’t
                Simon’s real father, you see. Geoff was Simon’s father, but he left me only a month or two before Simon was
                born. He didn’t want children. Then I met Peter. He was very good to me and fell in love. Soon after that,
                Peter married me. He was a good husband and good father to Simon. But Simon never knew the true story. After
                found Geoff’s letters, he was very angry with me. We didn’t talk for two days. Then Simon left home. That
                was ten months ago now. Where is he now? I have no idea. But I can’t live without him. </p>

            <p>Wing it’s no good. – I said. I don’t want to listen to that CD again. Not after five times. There’s nothing
                there. I must tell Mrs.Jones tomorrow I can’t help her anymore.
                Wait! -said Wing. I have got an idea. We’re listening to the wrong things. We need to listen one more time.
                But I need the computer for that. So, he played the CD on the computer. This time we heard different noises
                in the background. These noises were very quiet before. But on the computer, we could hear them easily.
                First, we heard people’s voices in the background. Then we heard the sound of coins. </p>
